# GGJ18 _ Paper Planes
## Paper planes
Paper Plane is a multiplayer, single button COOP game. 
Each player control a paper plane and can press a button to transfert weight from one another. 
The goal is to dodge the obstacles as long as you can.

We made this game using Unity in under 48 hours as a team of 5 people.
We had a lot of fun working on this game and hope you'll enjoy it.
